    <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Once meat is browned, add can of Ragú along with 3 dried bay leafs and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, 
            and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine Ricotta cheese with egg, 3 tbs parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Spread 1 1/2 cups of Ragú sauce in the bottom of a baking dish (preferably 9 by 12 - inch) used for lasagna. 
            Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of
             mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps for following layers, and top off with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil making sure the foil does not touch the cheese to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and let cool for 15 minutes</li>
